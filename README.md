### Hi there, I'm Guilherme, Data Engineer 🧑🏻‍💻

Welcome to my repository! Here you will find a collection of projects that I have worked on as a data engineer. As a data engineer, my goal is to build and maintain robust data pipelines that can handle large volumes of data and support various data-driven applications.

My projects cover a wide range of topics, from real-time data processing and analysis to machine learning and data visualization. I use a variety of tools and technologies, including AWS, GCP, Python, SQL, and more, to build scalable and efficient data solutions.
